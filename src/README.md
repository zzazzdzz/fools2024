## Fools2024: Fight Simulation Program

Fools2024 (TheZZAZZGlitch's April Fools Event 2024) was a non-profit fan-based project created for the Pok√©mon glitching and hacking community on April 1st, 2024.
One of the project's components was a small fangame, called the Fight Simulation Program. This is the source code for the mentioned game.

Note: If you just want to **play** the game, you don't need to bother with the source code - just download a precompiled version by following the instructions on the [main site](https://zzazzdzz.github.io/fools2024).

## Notes

The game was created in GMS2 (https://gamemaker.io), which is free to use non-commercially. A project file is included with this source code release (IDE version 2024.2.0.132). However, some of the assets have been replaced as follows:
 - All sound and music files have been replaced with [Quack.wav](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38hG664l1Cw).
 - All sprites have been replaced with empty placeholder graphics containing the sprite's name and layer ID.

This was done to avoid issues with licensing and copyright. Trying to compile the project in that state will likely result in a cursed unplayable mess. Fully restoring the project file and obtaining all the required assets is left as an exercise to the reader.
